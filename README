# 🚀 NixOS Configuration with Sway

This repository contains my NixOS configuration, adapted from [snd's configuration](https://codeberg.org/snd/nixos_conf). Key modifications include:

- 🖼️ **Window Manager**: Transitioned to Sway.
- 🐚 **Shell Theme**: Migrated from starship to p10k for zsh.
- 🖋️ **Editor**: In the process of customizing a Neovim configuration.
- 🚫 **Server Components**: Removed unnecessary server configurations.
